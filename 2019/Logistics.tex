  \item A successful integration of the SORA 3 payload will include the following: \newline
    The payload can successfully communicate will HASP systems which includes sending/receiving commands and downlinking data packets. A successful thermal vacuum test of the payload will ensure that the payload and its components remains fully powered (within the HASP limits) at all times, the astrobiology system is able to deploy and retract autonomously in response to changes in pressure, and the data recorded and received by the payload's instruments are accurate. Since the membrane filters used in our astrobiology system are expensive, we will not use any filters during integration.    
  \item List all expected integration steps:
    \begin{enumerate}[label = -]
    \item Mechanical:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item Ensure that the payload is securely fastened to the HASP gondola.
      \item Confirm that the astrobiology system properly deploys and retracts.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Electrical:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item The overall amperage draw of the payload remains within the \SI{2.5}{\ampere} limit throughout the entire test.
      \item Confirm that each subsystem receives the appropriate amount of power for operation.
      \item The electrical properties of the organic solar cells are properly recorded.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item Communications:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item The payload can properly receive and process commands sent from HASP.
      \item The payload can send corruption-free data packets to HASP.
        % \item Appropriate data storage (do a self-check and verify data collection rate.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item List all checks that will determine a successful integration:
    If all items listed in sections F. and G., Integration will have been successful.
  \item List any additional LSU personnel support needed for a successful integration other than directly related to the HASP integration (i.e. lifting, moving equipment, hotel information/arrangements, any special delivery needsâ€¦): \newline
    None.
  \item List any LSU supplied equipment that may be needed for a successful integration: \newline
    None.
